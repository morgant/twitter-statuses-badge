OVERVIEW
--------

A modification of the official Twitter JavaScript badge originally found here:

   http://twitter.com/account/badge

This modification provides insertion of the user's image (linking to their twitter page), displaying one or more of the user's recent tweets (including time posted, linking to that tweet's permalink), plus a bunch of CSS hooks for the list items.

This package contains an html file and associated CSS & image files, but they are merely an example of usage and only the mtaTwitterStatuses.js JavaScript file is needed (it can be embeded directly in any HTML document, if you prefer).

BASIC INSTRUCTIONS

There are three steps to using mtaTwitterStatuses.js:

1) Include the JavaScript in the HEAD of your HTML (or paste it in it's entirety):

	<script type="text/javascript" src="your/path/to/mtaTwitterStatuses.js"></script>

2) Include the mtaTwitter DIV element somewhere in the BODY of your HTML:

	<div id="mtaTwitter"></div>

3) Include the Twitter JavaScript call in the BODY of your HTML (replacing my Twitter account name, 'morgant', with your own). You can change "count=5" to fetch more or fewer updates. For simplicity, you can paste it in immediately after the aforementioned DIV, but I'd suggest inserting it just before the closing </body> tag to ensure that your HTML content still loads in its entirety, even if Twitter is down:

	<script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/morgant.json?callback=mtaTwitterCallback&amp;count=5"></script>

That's it! Let me know if you have any questions, bug reports, or feature requests.
